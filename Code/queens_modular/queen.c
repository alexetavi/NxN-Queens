/**
* @file main.c
* @brief Function queen(int row, int n) is checking for proper positioning of queen.
 We are re looking for a position for our queen on the row "row". If there is a valid
* position,the queen it is placed, then call the function recursively: "queen(row+1,n)".
If a position isnâ€™t found in this call the program will abandon that solution, and go 
*back to where it was before. There, it will check again for the next value of column,
* and if the position is valid, it is then going to try again for row + 1, until there 
*is a valid solution there. When it finds one, it is going to call queen() again, 
*with row + 1.
